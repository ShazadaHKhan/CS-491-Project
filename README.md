**Hello this is my CS 491 Project where I attempt to create an app that allows users to creater an account as a student or teacher and actually message one another in order make it easier for them to communicate and develope learning plans together.**

Here is a screenshot of the login page that includes the option to either login as a student or a teacher.

The design was meant to be very simplistic and have the ability to look pleasing as well as easy on the eyes. I really liked the original logo so I kept it but I will attempt to change it in the future for something that matches better. 


Here is a screenshot of the registration page.
