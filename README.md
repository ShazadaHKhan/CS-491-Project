**Hello this is my CS 491 Project where I attempt to create an app that allows users to create an account as a student or teacher and actually message one another in order make it easier for them to communicate and develope learning plans together.**

## Here is a screenshot of the login page that includes the option to either login as a student or a teacher:

**The design was meant to be very simplistic and have the ability to look pleasing as well as easy on the eyes. I really liked the original logo so I kept it but I will attempt to change it in the future for something that matches better.**


## Here is a screenshot of the registration page:

**Very similar comments. The page is very simple and straightforward and should not take too much time to complete.**

# When you log-in:

**In this page you can see the page that pops up once you enter the correct required credentials. You can check your messages that were sent to you by either teachers or other students. You can change info you put in for yourself such as age, school info, or major. You can Sign out if you are done browsing or you can check the forums that people post. If you scroll alittle further down you can see a button that allows you to post but due to limited screen size, you are unable to see it. The design was not what I intended it to be but with the lack of any good free materials for the icon and the banner, I was unable to design it to my likeing.**

## When posting a topic:

**This is an example of what it looks like when you're posting the a discussion topic to the forum. Currently the tags have no purpose because I have not implemented a search feature yet and the loading buffer keeps displaying itself in a constant loop for some reason. Overall, the layout box for the posting is very basic and functions as it is supposed to.**

## Looking at messages:

**This is the way the messages inbox currently looks. The font needs much work and so does the wallpaper I chose to use for it (looks quite depressing).But on the basis of having no messages being recieved, Im guessing it A-OK to describe that feeling with such a sad backdrop. Only problem is that the background remains even after you recieve a message which definitley is not supposed to happen.**

## Future Release Features:

**The next step is to clean-up alot of the clunky mess within the app. These features can be summarized with the following points:**

- Improving overall look and quality of the app. Attempt to make it more user-friendly and pleasing to the eyes by hopefully dding more premium textures and colors.

- Decreasing load times so that the app can be snappy and a person and see posts and reply wuickly without having to wait.

- Improved notificaiton system. Currently it notifies when someone responds to your post but does not say who and what the response is to allow easier access to responses.

- More personalization. Alot of close friends/relaitves wanted this app to have more ways so the individual can distinguish themselves form the rest whilst also leaving details that allow them to connect better with those people on their campus. 

- Put in moderator settings. Currentlly I am the only administrator of the entire app and am also the one who moderates everything. Once the numebr of users increases so wil the demand of fatser response to feedback and error reports. Also, theres a possibility that certain users will use the app innappropriatley which could end up being detrimental to the reputation of the app and instill a fdalse image of what the purpose of the app is. With moderators around they can help minimize the occurence of this problem and increase general peace.

- Teacher only or Student only flags. I'm sure students do not want teachers snooping in on their conversations and vice versa. I intend to implement it so that only those with a valid id and student user/teacher user are allowed to view certian posts. This way the if tehcers have certain concerns that they wish to address to all teachers(or specific ones)they can rest assured that only teachers will be able to respond and provide advice.

- IOS Compatability. Currently this app can only run on andriod which is a hige blow towards alot of people who use a mobile OS other than ANDROID OS (Namely IOS). I would like to port the app over and make it so that users from both platfomrs can communicate with eachother seamlessly and not feel that one system has an advantage over the other.
