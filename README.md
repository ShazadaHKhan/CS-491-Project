**Hello this is my CS 491 Project where I attempt to create an app that allows users to creater an account as a student or teacher and actually message one another in order make it easier for them to communicate and develope learning plans together.**

Here is a screenshot of the login page that includes the option to either login as a student or a teacher.

The design was meant to be very simplistic and have the ability to look pleasing as well as easy on the eyes. I really liked the original logo so I kept it but I will attempt to change it in the future for something that matches better. 


Here is a screenshot of the registration page.

Very similar comments. The page is very simple and straightforward and should not take too much time to complete.

In this page you can see the page that pops up once you enter the correct required credentials. You can check your messages that were sent to you by either teachers or other students. You can change info you put in for yourself such as age, school info, or major. You can Sign out if you are done browsing or you can check the forums that people post. If you scroll alittle further down you can see a button that allows you to post but due to limited screen size, you are unable to see it.
